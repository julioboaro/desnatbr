In 2014, EM-DAT started enhancing its contents by geocoding its natural disaster records (except for the biological disasters) from the year 2000 onwards. For each event, the current text location was transformed into code(s) for administrative unit(s) affected. Related shape files were created for each specific event, which were geo-referenced until the second administrative unit (e.g. Admin0 = country, Admin1 = state, Admin2 = county). The corresponding geocode is based on the classification from GAUL - Global Administrative Unit Layers (FAO). Users will now be able to download the dataset including administrates units (Admin1 and Admin2 codes). Further development are ongoing, in which we plan to make both the shapefiles and the complete revised guidelines available.
